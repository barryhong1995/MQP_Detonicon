      CONTROLS:                                                                                   
          Control a player with arrow keys (or WASD).                                             
          Place a bomb at your position with space bar.

          Placed bombs can be kicked by moving player into them.                                  
          Placed bombs explode after a set time, in a plus shaped pattern of width 1.             
          Increasing bomb explosion length increases size of each arm of plus pattern.            
          Green walls can be broken by an explosion.
