Map basics

Build maps by copying template.txt and modifying the copy.

MAKE SURE BUILT MAP CONTAINS 'map' IN THE FILENAME.

DO NOT add characters past the 98x40 perimeter marked by x's.
Load in maps (with custom values if you want such as speed of enclosing perimeter) in ManagerMap.cpp in drawMap() function.

Comments begin with '#' and are ignored when reading in the map
'x' stands for the automatically spawned border of unbreakable walls
'CC' stands for the center of each border
'U' stands for unbreakable walls
'B' stands for breakable walls
'S' stand for spawn point
' ' stands for blank space
